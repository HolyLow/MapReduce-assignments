Question 1:  What is the sized of the compressed index?

OSX "Get Info" on the folder containing the directory named "cimbriano-index" says its 6.6MB.

Grading
=======

Everything looks fine, except why not just use `PairOfStringInt`
in Cloud9 instead of writing you own `TextIntWritablePairComparable`?

Score: 35/35
